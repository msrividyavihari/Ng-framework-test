Creating web service end points is an important task, as it help developers to understand what it consumes and produces.
The URI which we create needs to be logical and self-explanatory, for this will follow rest convention to create APIs.

I have taken extract from the following  https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/[link] to follow resource naming convention.

==== Versioning

Use URI versioning when creating URI, doing this we can give different implementation for the same business scenario.
Also, this help in maintaining backward compatible URIs and slowly deprecating the currently used URIs.

.Versioning Scenario
--
Suppose you have a URI which produces individual data that return only first_name and last_name in response.

* http://api.example.com/data-collection/v1/individual/{id}

Now, there is a requirement where we need to change the response structure and still we need to have the above URI.
In this case you can create a new version with updated URI as below.

* http://api.example.com/data-collection/v2/individual/{id}
--

==== Naming Convention

Use nouns to represent resources::
RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing (noun) instead of referring to an action (verb) because nouns have properties
which verbs do not have â€“ similar to resources have attributes.
Some examples of a resource and their resource URIs can be designed as below
* Users of the system
* User Notices
* Case Task

----
http://api.example.com/v1/correspondence/notices/{id}
http://api.example.com/v1/admin/tasks
http://api.example.com/v1/data-collection/individual/{id}
http://api.example.com/v1/data-collection/case/individual/{id}
http://api.example.com/v1/data-collection/case _//Send case number in request body_
http://api.example.com/v1/user-management/users/{id}
----

[CAUTION]
====
* Never create an endpoint where you are sending PII data in URL as GET params, and as a variable in an endpoint.
* Create a POST request and send data in body when we are dealing with PII.
* Developers can use unique_trans_id to fetch resource data.
====

Never use CRUD function names in URIs::
URIs should not be used to indicate that what CRUD operation is being perform. URIs should be used to uniquely identify
resources and not any action upon them. HTTP request methods should be used to indicate which CRUD function is performed.

----
HTTP GET http://api.example.com/correspondence/v1/notices  # <.>
HTTP POST http://api.example.com/correspondence/v1/notices  # <.>

HTTP GET http://api.example.com/data-collection/v1/individual/income/{id} # <.>
HTTP PUT http://api.example.com/data-collection/v1/individual/income/{id} # <.>
HTTP DELETE http://api.example.com/data-collection/v1/individual/income/{id} # <.>
----

<.> Get all notices.
<.> Create new notice.
<.> Get individual's income for given Id.
<.> Update individual's income for given Id.
<.> Delete individual's income for given Id.

==== Endpoints

This section will help you in understanding how to name an endpoint. We recommend following points to keep in mind while
creating an endpoint.

. Name the rest controller path with what type of operation it's going to perform. Please refer below examples +
If the controller is going to perform operations on an individual then name the root path as *"/individual"* +
If the controller is going to perform operations on a notice then name the root path as *"/notice"*
. Name individual endpoint according to what operation it does and do not use method name in the URI endpoint.
Refer <<naming-convention, Naming convention>> on how each endpoint should be named.
. Never pass PII data in request params or path variables.
. Try to use combination of HTTP methods and method overloading pattern of java.

[source, java, linenums]
.Incorrect way of naming the endpoints
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/appIndvFetch") # <.>
public class AppIndvFetchController {

    private final ApplicationIndvFetchService applicationIndvFetchService;

    @PostMapping("/fetchAppIndv") # <.> <.> <.>
    public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse> fetchAppIndv(@RequestBody AppIndvListRequest appIndvListRequest)  { # <.>
        //code commented for brevity
    }
}
----
<.> It does not help to understand what this controller is about and what functions it's going to perform.
<.> Exposes method name as URI endpoint.
<.> Incorrect HTTP method used.
<.> No versioning done.
<.> No validation annotation added.

[source, java, linenums]
.Correct way of naming the endpoints
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/search") # <.>
public class AppIndvFetchController {

    private final ApplicationIndvFetchService applicationIndvFetchService;


    @GetMapping("/") # <.>
    public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse> search(@RequestParam String appNum, @RequestParam boolean activeSw)  { # <.>
        //code commented for brevity
    }

    @PostMapping("/") # <.>
    public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse> search(@Valid @RequestBody SearchRequest searchRequest)  { # <.>
        //code commented for brevity
    }

    @GetMapping("/individual/{appNum}") # <.>
    public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse> search(@NotNull @PathVariable String appNum)  {
        //code commented for brevity
    }
}
----
<.> By reading the root path we understand that this controller has functionality related to search.
<.> This endpoint says that you can search application in respective project with passing two request params.
<.> If endpoint have more than 2 or 3 request param we recommend creating a POST request and passing data in request body.
Here we have repeated same mapping path as in point 1, but the difference is in HTTP methods and method signature.
<.> This endpoint says that we can search all individual belonging to application number.

[TIP]
====
- Naming an endpoint logically is very important, try to brainstorm before creating any endpoint.
- Try to reuse the endpoint with HTTP method variations and method overloading concept.
- Prioritise REST Api conventions instead of just creating it randomly.
- Please look <<anti-patterns, Anti Patterns>> section for examples.

===== Anti-patterns

. Anti-Pattern Examples
[cols="4,4,4", options="header"]
|===

| Anti-pattern URI | Reason | Resolution

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/appIndvFetch/fetchAppIndv``
a|
* Endpoint name is too verbose.
* Exposes method name using in the file.
* No versioning.
| _GET_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/v1/indiv/{app_num}``

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/appsearch/findApps``
a|
* Same synonyms use (e.g. search, find)
* We already have context as app-reg so we know where we are searching. No need to mention _"appsearch"_ again.
* No versioning.
| _GET_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/search/v1/{app_num}``

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/api/application/findAuthRepDetailsForAppNum/{appNum}/{caseNum}``
a|
* Exposing case number which is a PII.
* Inconsistent with above URI endpoint created in same application. The above URIs do not start start with */api/*
* If a developer use same name with 2 path variable if will confuse the Spring framework and results in error.

a|
- _GET_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/v1/authRep/{app_num}`` +
- _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/v1/authRep`` [gray]_//Pass case number in request body_

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/createAuthRep``
a|
* Exposing function name in URI endpoint.
| POST \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/api/v1/authRep`` [gray]_//Pass auth rep data in request body_

| _GET_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/deleteAuthRepDataForAppNum/{app_num}``
a|
* Exposing function name in URI endpoint.
* Incorrect HTTP method used. Here we are deleting a record and using GET method instead of DELETE method
| _DELETE_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/api/v1/authRep/{unique_id_of_auth_rep_table}``

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/application/associateCase/{appNum}/{caseNum}``
a|
* Exposing case number which is a  PII.
* The URL endpoint name is too verbose and expose method name.
| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``app_reg/v1/associate`` [gray]_//Send app_num and case_num in request body_

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/api/correspondence/generateManual/caseSearch``
a|
* Context root is redundant _'co or correspondence'_ both means same.
* Developer know they are searching notices for a case, no need to say what this endpoint is going to search. You can always
pass generate_manual_sw in request body to get a specific type of notice.
* There should be always a global search in respective applications and URI should not be specific as in this example.
| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/v1/search`` [gray]_//Send case_num in request body_

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/api/correspondence/massMailing/createOrUpdateRequest``
a|
* This URI violates single use principle, it does two different this here create and update
* Context root is repeated.
* Updates need to be a PUT request
a|
- _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/v1/mailing`` +
- _PUT_ \http://api.example.com/``co/v1/mailing/{id}``


| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/api/correspondence/massMailing/delete``
a|
* The URI business operation contradicts with HTTP method.
| _DELETE_ \http://api.example.com/``co/v1/massMailing/{id}``

| _POST_ \http://api.example.com/``co/api/correspondence/viewHistory/searchHistory``
a|
* We can use same URI as of search to get historical notice.
* The URI name used is very confusing.
| _POST_ http://api.example.com/``co/search`` [gray]_//Pass customized parameters in request body to find historical notices._
